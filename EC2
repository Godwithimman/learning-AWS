What EC2 really is (plain meaning)

An EC2 instance is a server in the cloud.

It behaves like a normal computer:
• it has CPU, RAM, disk, and network
• you can install software
• you can run applications
• you can shut it down or delete it

The difference is elasticity:
You can create it in minutes, resize it anytime, and destroy it when you’re done.

1. Application and OS Image (AMI – Amazon Machine Image)

This is the soul of the instance. It defines what software is installed when the server is born.

What it includes
• Operating system (Linux, Windows)
• Pre-installed applications (Nginx, Docker, WordPress, custom images)
• System configurations

Use cases
• Amazon Linux → general-purpose, AWS-optimized workloads
• Ubuntu → developer-friendly, package-rich environments
• Windows Server → .NET apps, Active Directory
• Marketplace AMIs → ready-made stacks (WordPress, Splunk, Kali Linux)
• Custom AMI → reuse a hardened or preconfigured server across teams

2. Instance Type
This defines the hardware personality of the server.

What it controls
• CPU power
• Memory (RAM)
• Network performance
• Cost per hour

Use cases
• t2/t3 → low traffic websites, learning, testing
• m5 → application servers
• c5 → compute-heavy workloads
• r5 → memory-heavy databases

3. Key Pair (Login)
This is how you prove you’re allowed inside the server.

What it is
• A public/private SSH key pair
• AWS stores the public key
• You keep the private key

Use cases
• Secure SSH access to Linux instances
• No passwords = reduced brute-force risk
• Required for admin access (especially first login)

Lose the private key and the server becomes a locked vault.

4. Network Settings

This decides where the instance lives and who can talk to it.

What it includes
• VPC (virtual private cloud)
• Subnet (public or private)
• Auto-assign public IP
• Security Group (firewall rules)

Use cases
• Public subnet → web servers accessible from the internet
• Private subnet → databases and internal services
• Security groups → allow only SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
• SOC relevance → controlling attack surface

5. Configure Storage

This defines how and where data is stored.

What it includes
• Root volume (OS disk)
• Additional EBS volumes
• Volume type (gp3, io1, etc.)
• Size and performance

Use cases
• Small volume → lightweight servers
• Large volume → databases, logs
• High IOPS volumes → performance-critical apps
• Encrypted volumes → compliance and security

Storage survives instance restarts, sometimes even termination.

6. Advanced Details

This is the control room. Optional, powerful, often ignored.

Key options
• User data (startup scripts)
• IAM role attachment
• Shutdown behavior
• Placement settings

Use cases
• User data → auto-install packages on boot
• IAM role → allow EC2 to access S3, CloudWatch securely
• Shutdown behavior → stop vs terminate
• Automation → zero-touch server provisioning
